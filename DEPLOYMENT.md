# Deployment Guide

This guide provides the basic steps to deploy this application and connect it to a custom domain.

## 1. Deploy the Application

You need to host your application on a server that is accessible from the internet. There are many options for this, including:

- **Cloud Providers:**
  - Amazon Web Services (AWS)
  - Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
  - Microsoft Azure
- **Platform as a Service (PaaS):**
  - Heroku
  - Vercel
  - Netlify
- **Virtual Private Servers (VPS):**
  - DigitalOcean
  - Linode
  - Vultr

The specific steps for deployment will vary depending on the provider you choose. Generally, you will need to:

1.  Push your code to a Git repository (e.g., GitHub, GitLab).
2.  Set up a new server or service on your chosen platform.
3.  Configure the server to install your application's dependencies (`npm install`).
4.  Set up the necessary environment variables (as defined in your `.env` file).
5.  Start your application (`node server.js` or using a process manager like `pm2`).

## 2. Configure Your Domain's DNS

Once your application is deployed and you have a public IP address or hostname for your server, you need to configure your domain's DNS settings.

1.  Log in to your domain registrar's website (e.g., GoDaddy, Namecheap, Google Domains).
2.  Navigate to the DNS management section for your domain.
3.  Create a new DNS record:
    - **If you have a static IP address:** Create an `A` record that points your domain (e.g., `example.com`) to the IP address of your server.
    - **If you have a hostname (e.g., from Heroku or Vercel):** Create a `CNAME` record that points your domain (e.g., `www.example.com`) to the hostname provided by your hosting service.

It may take some time for DNS changes to propagate across the internet.

## 3. Set Up a Reverse Proxy and SSL (Recommended)

For a production environment, it is highly recommended to use a reverse proxy like Nginx or Apache in front of your Node.js application. This has several benefits:

- **SSL/TLS Termination:** You can configure the reverse proxy to handle HTTPS, which is essential for security. You can get free SSL certificates from [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/).
- **Load Balancing:** If you have multiple instances of your application running, a reverse proxy can distribute traffic between them.
- **Serving Static Files:** A web server is generally more efficient at serving static files than a Node.js application.

### Example Nginx Configuration

Here is a basic example of an Nginx configuration file for a reverse proxy:

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name your_domain.com www.your_domain.com;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:3000; # Assuming your app runs on port 3000
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
    }
}
```

After setting this up, you would then use a tool like `certbot` to automatically obtain and install a Let's Encrypt SSL certificate.

This guide provides a high-level overview. The exact steps will depend on your specific hosting environment and domain registrar.
